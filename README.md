# Life Chronicles Project Proposal 

<img src='full-logo-new-170801-e1507786316552.png'>

This project will span beyond our usual quarter length projects and is being done in collaboration with [Life Chronicles](http://www.lifechronicles.org/).

## What is Life Chronicles

A local non-profit that aims to help people at end of life create and perserve memories for their loved ones. As said on their site:

> LifeChronicles began simply as a way to preserve memories. It has grown into a remarkable way to bring healing and connection to families with loved ones – whether they be seniors or those facing serious illness – who are facing the end of life, and it allows them to do so with dignity, integrity, and respect.

## Our Involvement 

We were contacted by an associate of Life Chronicles to design a mobile app that will facilitate the process of making videos for the organization. Our goal is to have a mobile app will be utilzed in production, and systemize a database for videos that will be recorded utilizing the app. 


## Needed

+ Teams
	+ Product Manager: one person who will be responsible for product and keep track of teammates, work with Ravi and Arthur, and keep communications with Life Chronicles Rep. 
	+ Anyone interested in learning app development or anyone with experience in it 
+ Commitment beyond a quarter, since this will be a project that will actually be utilized a lot of time will go into this, but we are expected it to be a lengthy project. 

### Expected Technologies

Arthur will be helping out with the desired tools and will be overseeing a lot of the project, but ultimately we want this project to be your team's responsibility, not ours. 

+ git: for team collaboration, will most likely use [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) for repository 
+ [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
+ [Expo](https://expo.io/)

More will be discussed as well with Arthur as the project roadmap begins!
